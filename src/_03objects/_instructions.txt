R8.1 Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to the ability to hide the implementation details of a class.
It is useful because a programmer making use of an existing class
only needs to interact with the class via the public interface
(such as get and set methods) rather than worry about the implementation details.

R8.4 Public interface

The public interface is a set of methods, such as the accessor and mutator methods
of an object's variables, that can be used to interact with the class and
object instances of the class.

They are difference from the implementation of a class in that these public
methods can be accessed outside the class and can tie into parts of the same program
outside the class, whereas the implementation refers to the data structure of the class
and the particular way that the methods within the class have been defined.

R8.7 Instance versus static

An instance method operates on an object created via the class, whereas a static method
operates on the class as a whole and is not specific to a particular object created via
the class (in fact you cannot call a static method via an object).

R8.8 Mutator and accessor

A mutator method changes the value of one or more instance variables,
i.e. updates an object's data. An accessor retrieves the value without
making any updates.

R8.9 Implicit parameter

An implicit parameter passed by specifying the object variable (which refers to an instance
of a class) typically before the method, whereas an explicit parameter is passed typically in
parenthesis after the method name.

R8.10 Implicit parameter

An instance method can have only one implicit parameter. A static method cannot have any
implicit parameters. An instance method must have at least the same number of mandatory explicit
parameters as specified in the implementation of that particular method in the class.

R8.12 Constructors

A class can have an unlimited number of constructors, including none. If a class has more than one
constructors than the constructor that is used depends on the paremeters (if any) that were supplied
when instantiating the object.

R8.16 Instance variables

The private implementation is hidden insofar as private instance variables cannot be referred to outside
the class. I cannot try to access the variable directly anywhere outside the class. That means that I'm
forced to use the public interface, get and set methods, to find data about a particular object.

R8.19 The this reference

The this reference is an implicit parameter that refers to an instance of the class. It can be within
the implemenation of a class to make it obvious that a method is being called on the same instance of
the class, such as when a method is called on instance A, the method contains code to operate on this,
which refers to instance A.

R8.20 Zero, null, false, empty String

What is the difference between the number zero, the null reference, the value false,
and the empty string?

The number zero is an int. When an int variable is created without initialization, it stores 0.
The null reference can be assigned to any Object such as a String to indicate that the variable
does not have a memory reference. The value false is a boolean. The empty string is a valid String
with length 0.

Programming Exercises: Name your packages according to the Programming Exercise identifier, except
replace the period with underscore. You will want a Driver class (with a static main() method) to drive your program.
See package P0_2 for an example.
