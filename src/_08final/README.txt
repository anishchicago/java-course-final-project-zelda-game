The idea for this project was to explore something similar to the Mario game, in a more 3 dimensional way a la classic
Legend of Zelda games.

Foes can be defeated by slashing Link's sword (space bar).
Some foes such as the soldier are harder to defeat because they have extra health and parts of their body are invulnerable.

Collisions with the wall are implemented.
